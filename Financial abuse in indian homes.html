    <article>
        <p>When we talk about violence against women, we traditionally imagine shouting, bruises, physical harm, or visible wounds. But there is a quieter, insidious form of violence that leaves no marks on the body, yet slowly erodes a woman's confidence, independence, choices, and ability to live with dignity. <span class="accent-text">Financial abuse.</span></p>

        <p>Across India, and even within the most educated households, the signs are everywhere. It is subtle, often justified as "care wrapped in cultural expectation" or "a husband's responsibility," and therefore rarely questioned. Many women fail to recognize this control until it is too late.</p>

        <h2>Control Disguised as Care</h2>

        <p>Financial abuse rarely appears dramatic at first. It often begins in small, everyday moments. A woman who wants to take up a job after marriage is told gently by her husband, <span class="highlight">"Why do you need to struggle? I am earning enough. You just take care of the home."</span></p>

        <p>It sounds caring; it feels like protection. But as years pass, she slowly realises the trap. She has no income, no savings, and absolutely no financial autonomy. To buy a saree, to buy medicine, or even to visit her own parents' home, she is reduced to asking for money. The denial of work becomes a denial of self-respect. It is not just about money; it is about <strong>dignity</strong>.</p>

        <h2>The Cultural Trap of Dependency</h2>

        <div class="quote-box">
            "Women are not allowed to go and work outside the home. Society will say that if we earn, then we will keep our husbands under our feet."
        </div>

        <p>A woman from Rajasthan explains the cultural pressure behind this sentiment effectively. This is not just a rural issue; it is a mindset that permeates all classes. The fear that a financially independent woman will become "arrogant" or "neglect the family" is deeply rooted. According to the Ministry of Labour and Employment/NSSO, <span class="accent-text">nearly 75% of Indian women do not participate in the formal workforce.</span> This statistic represents millions of women whose safety net is entirely dependent on the goodwill of their spouse.</p>

        <h2>Jobs Without Wages</h2>

        <p>The abuse is not limited to housewives. High-earning, professional women are also victims. In many households, the "rule" is that the husband manages the finances. Consequently, the wife's ATM card and passbook reside in the husband's wallet. She works day and night, yet she has no right to ask where her money goes.</p>
        
        <p>She earns, but she has to beg for her daily commute fare. This reality is glaringly reflected in the Tata AIA Life Insurance survey: <span class="highlight">over 59% of working women do not make their own financial decisions</span>, despite contributing economically to the household. She is an earner in name only.</p>

        <h2>Dowry and Coerced Debt</h2>

        <p>In the Indian context, <strong>'Stridhan'</strong> (gold and assets given to a woman during marriage) is legally her exclusive property. Yet, in the majority of homes, this gold is moved to bank lockers or sold for the husband's business needs immediately after the wedding. Pawning her gold without her consent is one of the most common forms of asset stripping.</p>

        <p>A woman from Maharashtra shared a harrowing account: "My husband took me to the bank, made me sign the documents, got the money, used it all, and now he is saying: <em>'The loan is in your name, so repay it yourself.'</em>"</p>

        <p>This is <strong>coerced debt</strong>. By destroying her credit score and burdening her with liabilities she didn't incur, the abuser ensures she cannot leave. She is trapped not just by marriage, but by debt.</p>

        <h2>The Legal Reality</h2>

        <p>It is crucial to understand that this behavior is not just "bad marriage dynamics"—it is illegal. The <strong>Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (2005)</strong> explicitly recognizes <span class="accent-text">economic abuse</span> as a punishable offense. This includes the deprivation of all or any economic or financial resources to which the aggrieved person is entitled.</p>

        <p>However, because this violence happens within the sanctity of the household budget, it remains the most underreported crime. It is the "lock on the door" that prevents victims from walking away. <span class="highlight">How do you escape an abusive marriage when you cannot afford the bus ticket to leave?</span></p>

        <h2>Redefining Partnership</h2>

        <p>To address this, we must stop viewing money as solely a "man’s domain." Financial literacy for women is not just about investment; it is about survival. A bank account that only she can access is not an act of rebellion; it is a fundamental human right that should not be surrendered.</p>

        <p>True partnership is transparent. It does not demand total control, nor does it hide passwords or create secret debts. Until we recognize that financial independence is a prerequisite for human dignity, millions of women will continue to live in golden cages—fed and clothed, but stripped of the power to say "no."</p>
